##Introduction:
The purpose of this repository is to research on different implementations for the set object in cpython. Set objects are an important data structure in Python that represent a collection of distinct elements. The set object in cpython is implemented using a hash table, which provides efficient lookups and insertions in average case time complexity of O(1). However, there are different ways to implement the hash table and optimize its performance. This project aims to explore and compare different implementations of the set object in cpython to understand their performance characteristics and tradeoffs.

##Project Description:
This repository contains a set of implementations of the set object in cpython, each with different design choices and optimizations. The implementations are built on top of cpython's existing implementation, with modifications to improve performance in certain scenarios. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive comparison of these implementations and their performance on different workloads. The results of this research can inform future improvements to the set object in cpython and other hash table-based data structures.
