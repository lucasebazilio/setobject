When we set B = 10000,
It is shown the difference in using the circular algorithm against the original one.
B = 10.000
                        
Original: Slots = 55000, Linear: 56601117.32, Random: 5008.932
Circular: Slots = 55000, Linear: 60123748.19, Random: 4943.58


We have a difference in linear probes around 3522630.87
Also we have a difference in random probes around 65.352
