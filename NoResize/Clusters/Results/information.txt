In this directory there are two folders.

Firstly, Clusters Formation, on which it can be seen, for different values of the LINEAR_PROBES parameter (B),
the formation of clusters as we increase the number of slots (S) filled in the hash table.

Secondly, Clusters Probability, which contains the normalized results of Clusters Formation.
Hence we can explore the magnitude of probability. That is, given an inserted element in the hash table,
what is the probability of landing in a cluster of a specific size.
